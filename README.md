**I'm in the [top 2% all-time on Stack Overflow](https://stackexchange.com/leagues/1/alltime/stackoverflow/2008-07-31/149428?sort=reputationchange#149428) (all-time) having helped over [8 million](https://stackoverflow.com/users/149428/taylor-edmiston?tab=topactivity) software developers over 15 years.**

I started programming on the frontend with HTML/CSS/JS in 2004, learned Java in 2008, and have been writing various other languages, [especially Python](https://xkcd.com/353/), from 2009 to present.

I have ~10 years of professional software engineering experience (~20 years since I started programming) from frontend to backend to shells, sysadmin, DevOps, CI/CD, security, etc.
