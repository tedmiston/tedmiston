### Taylor D. Edmiston

**I'm in the [top 3% on Stack Overflow](https://stackexchange.com/leagues/1/alltime/stackoverflow/2008-07-31/149428?sort=reputationchange#149428) (all-time) having helped over [7.5 million](https://stackoverflow.com/users/149428/taylor-edmiston?tab=topactivity) software developers.**

I started programming with HTML/CSS/JS in 2004, learned Java in 2008, and have been writing various other languages, [especially Python](https://xkcd.com/353/), from 2009 to present.

I have 10+ years of "professional" software engineering experience (~20 years total since I first started programming) from frontend to backend to shells, sysadmin across the major OSes, DevOps, security, and everything in-between.
